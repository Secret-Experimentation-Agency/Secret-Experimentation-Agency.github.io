            Mafia is a social deduction game. Everyone receives a role, alligned with a team.<br>
            Every role has a special ability, useful for eliminating opposing teams.<br>
            Vote for someone each day, and the person with the most votes will get eliminated by the end of the cycle.<br>
            Roles vary for each game, along with teams and mechanics/twists. <br>
